    <h2>Matthew Slater</h2>
    <p>

I am a motivated, adaptable, responsible and highly motivated individual who is a team
player but also capable of working alone.
I have excellent inter personal skills with a likable
and friendly personality.
I have worked in the motor trade industry most of my adult life.
I left school and went on to collage to where I acquired a Nvq level 2 in motor mechanics 
I have worked in different sections of the motor trade from
  <br><br>
1. Breaking down cars and light commercials for parts for resale on the second hand market <br>
2. Sales including telephone sales and also the sale of parts on the internet ebay gumtree and part finder system etc<br> 
3. Preparation of vehicles for sale (ordering parts for servicing the vehicles and carrying out the work to get the vehicle ready for sale)<br>
4. The sale of cars and light commercial vehicle in person and online
<br><br>                                                                                                                                             
Over the years i have seen how much IT  has taken over in the industry going from fault find by hand to now 90% of fault finding being down to IT
I have always had basic computer skills but also have always had an interest in the workings behind computers and now being able to come on the code nation course has showed me the 
The basics of code etc which has got me really interested not only in the it codeing in the motor industry but  to explore other avenues in code and it and eager to learn more
<br><br>
I had no experience in coding before this course and have found it really interesting and would like to make coding part of my education 
    </p>
    <br><br>
  <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
  <p>
  Information systems help decision-makers at a business to make informed decisions for the company. Information technology helps get prepared data on all areas of the business as it offers current data, background, and trend analysis. You’ll be able to utilize this nitty-gritty information on the company environment and finances to progress business execution within the long- and short-term.[1]<br><br>
  
  IT is needed in all areas of business from start up small businesses  to even the most cutting edge established businesses<br>
  IT can help a small one person business to research areas in the start up of a business to keep the business running once up and operational<br>
IT can help the the larger established businesses keep on top of competitors and also the running of there own business.

IT is used in most businesses now for Stock checking, paye, HR,data,Research,websites and selling platforms purchasing stock and the selling of stock 
More or less all businesses rely on a website or selling platform rather than front of house in businesses these days

</p>

<p>
  <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>

  I have found this site referencing  15 skills needed in project management and have chosen 5 i think are essential  skills in project management [2]<br>
  
  Skills needed<br><br>
  1. Leadership
  Being able to lead your team as well as manage them 
  It’s really important to be able to inspire others, set the vision and lead effectively<br><br>
  2. Negotiation
  Good negotiation skills will be an asset to their teams as they seek to resolve conflicts by finding the win-win scenarios for everyone.<br><br>
  3. Communication
  Communication is i think essential in project management in getting the job done 
  If communication does not happen you may find people not doing what there meant to be doing more than one person doing the same job leading to delay and confusion in the project <br><br>
  
  4. Critical Thinking
  Been able to think under pressure and make the right decision and being able to carry out those decisions without making the situation worse <br><br>
   
  5. Cost Control
  You need this skill to keep to budget and not let things over run when a project runs over this can put the whole project behind or cause it to fail<br><br>

  
  TOOLS NEEDED IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT
  
  1 TRELLO
  To keep yourself and team up to date on whats happening whats being done and what has been completed
  
  2 SLACK
  Again to share ideas links etc with each other on a project your working on and just to keep in touch with colleges
  
  3 DRAW.IO 
  To make a flowchart to help with the planning of a project
  
</p>
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. </h2>

<h2>TRELLO</h2>

Using trello to plan out IT tasks
Using different cards to keep up with what im doing and other people in the group are doing
Entering jobs to be done being done and done and also entering updates so other people can see what im doing and where im upto making sure people  aren't doing the same job twice<br>
<br>The kanban system is the use of job cards in sites such as trello
The cards can be set out into different columns of to be done, Doing,and done also more cards can be added if needed for other jobs needing to be done. 


<p>
  <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>

  I have found this site referencing  15 causes of project failure [3]<br>
  I have chosen 5 i think are the main reasons of project failure<br><br>
  
  
  
  1.Project managers who lack experience and training
  If you don't have the right skills for the job you just won't be able to get it done<br> <br>
  2.Failure to track progress
    Again if you don't have the right skills for the job and progress is not being tracked the job will not run to plan or on time<br><br>
  3.Ineffective leadership
  If you can not be an effective leader and lead a team that your meant to be leading you will lose focus of the job in hand and progress will not be made causing the project to fail<br><br>
  4.No use of formal methods and strategies
    If the methods are not followed correctly and strategies not used this again will cause the project to fail <br><br>
  5.Lack of detail in the project plans
    If there is a lack of details then people won't know how to complete the task properly and may lead to people all doing things different to what is needed again causing the project to fail
    
  <br>
 <h2> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
  I have researched git[4a] and github [4b]<br>
  
  I would find and use a text editor which is compatible with HTML and CSS
  Also a version control git hub  or git 
  Git is a version control system storage and git hub is a online place for people can collaborate code
  And to keep communication with the use of Slack and project progress with trello
  
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <h2> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2><br>

Trello helped the team to keep up to speed with everything what people were doing and also which jobs where being done and been done to let the team leader know so more jobs could be added and allocated if needed.<br>
Git is a type of vcs that helps track changes to files git helps  see what changes have been made who changed them and why<br>
Git hub is where people can share codes there working on with other people and can exchange ideas and help in working out problems with a code.<br><br>
Git would of helped the team keep up with the changes and who did them and why and git hub would have helped us get help with any problems with our codes if any came up we couldn't fix ourselves 

</p>
<p>
 <h2> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>

I  have found this website referencing GDPR [5][6]<br>
General Data Protection Regulation<br>
General Data Protection Regulation is a law  Companies have to abide by to keep people's personal data<br> 
Gdpr has recently been updated to comply with more up to date laws <br>
One of these upto date laws is to stop the pre ticked boxes giving a company automatic consent to store your personal data<br>
Also GDPR makes it easier for an individual to remove consent for a company to keep personal data<br>
Companies will also only be able to process data they really need requiring legal justification why they need the data<br><br>


Companies can receive fines for not complying with with GDPR regulations<br> 
Some companies i found  [7]<br><br>
Equifax £500,000<br><br>
BA British Airways £183M<br><br>
Facebook £500,000<br><br>
These fines where imposed because people data where not stored correctly and aloud hackers to obtain peoples personal data<br><br>

Here are some of an individuals rights i found [8]<br>

The right to be informed individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data<br>
The right of access Under the GDPR, data subjects have the right of access to personal. If they ask you, you must give data subjects<br>
The right to rectification This right under the GDPR remains largely unchanged. Data subjects can ask data controllers to erase or rectify inaccurate or incomplete data. The law gives you one month to comply with such requests.<br>
The right to erasure,Under the GDPR, individuals have to right to ask you to delete their personal data If you have processed there data unlawfully <br>
 <br><br>
This gives an individual more rights than the previous gdpr laws which have now been updated

</p>

  <h2> 2, Outcome 1 </h2>
<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
<p>I have used 1 page for my website starting off with my blog then moving on to  answering the question asked.<br> I have answered the questions to in the order i did them<br></p>


 <h2> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
I found this by reference [9]
Copyright is to protect other peoples creations as soon as a picture is taken it has a copyright a copyright is to stop people from using it and passing it off as there own work and profiting from it people can claim damages if a person has been found to use there images to profit from and the person could have to pay the person the profits made and also be told not to use the images without the owners permission by a court 
The fines imposed in the uk courts for using copyright images you could be  jailed for 6 months and or fined up to £50,000

</p>
<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them </h2>

I have found these references for blind people using computers [10] colour blindness [11]deaf and hard of hearing [12]<br>

Blind people use what's  called  assistive technology, including screen readers, refreshable braille displays to interact with high-tech products.<br><br>


Screen readers can give audio feedback or they can be connected to refreshable braille displays.<br>
Refreshable braille displays is an electronic way of reading braille pins on a device pop up and can be read like hardcopy braille<br><br> 
People who are colour blind.<br><br>
Websites should not rely on different colours for the outcome, it is also highly important that you don't use colours to relay important information<br>
People who are deaf<br>
Websites should provide multiple contact information and not rely on just a contact number <br>
Also
If a website has videos it should have subtitles or captions to help deaf people some websites have sign language videos attached also <br>
<br> 

<p><h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2></p>

I have used Visual Studio Code and Google Drive to create the website and content,<br> I used HTML and CSS the html for content and ccs for the styling
<br>

<p><h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2></p><br>
 
I have found the tools I have been given to use to be quite easy to use once shown, and with more time using them i would be able to adapt to using these tools in the future in everyday work,<br>
The trello board was a big help in keeping me up to date with the items that needed doing or going back over, I was able to do other things and then go back without forgetting <br>
Also the use of google drive i found easy to use and enjoyed the transfering over to Visual studio code and then back on to my webpage <br>
Html and css i found easy to pic up the basics and with time would also be able to adapt to using these tools also.<br><br>


<p><h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</p></h2>

<p>The tools I was given to use in the making of the website I found to be useful,VISUAL CODE TRELLO HTML AND CSS<br> I haven't made a website before so I don't know of any other tools that could be used,<br> because I haven't been introduced to them as of yet<br>

 <P><H2> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
  your website?<br> Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
  of openness.<br> What would you change?</H2></P>
<p> I am happy with the website i have created although it is the only website I have ever created,<br>
  To be able to learn how to make this has been a good experience for me<br> 
  I am happy with my website because i have been able to get the basics on there that are needed and show that I am able to use the tools given to me to make the website <br>
  With more experience I would maybe add menus and navigation tools also pictures etc <br><br></p>
  

<p> <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2></h2> </p> <br>

<p></p>Improvements could be made with more experience and from the introduction of navigation tools,<br> A improved mission statement,<br>Call to action text also make mobile friendly, and better call to action colors </p><br>

<p><h2> 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2></p>
<p>I believe the outcome have all been answered to the best of my knowledge and are fit for purpose 
</p><br><br>

<p><h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) </h2></p> <br>
<p><h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2></p>
<p>The benefits I found working with trello was i was able to keep track of where I was up to and able to start stop and return to the tasks that needed doing without forgetting the incomplete tasks still to be completed<br>
  The VS code i found to be quite an easy tool to use once introduced to it and the workings involved in creating the website,<br>
  I could have used these tools more productively and efficiently with more experience using them <br> 
  I don't think the website could have been built any better in a team as it more of a personal thing and would have taken more time with having to explain things to other people in the group about myself <br>
  </p>

  <p><h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2></p>
<p>I would maybe look for different tools available to build the website a bit quicker next time and see if i could use them better than the ones i used to build this site 
</p>
<p><h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  
</h2></p>
<p>Looking back the tools i use with the lack of knowledge and inexperience in using html and css would have slowed me down but with more knowledge and experience this would have made the process quicker.<br>
  I don't think the use of slack or working in a team would speed the productivity up on this project unless there was someone more experienced in the use of the html and css
  </p>



<p><h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2></p>
<p>I would use unit testing first<br> 
  Unit testing is the first level of software testing and carried out by software developers<br>
  To ensure the code or unit meets its design and behaves as intended<br>
  This will ensure there are no faults and the code runs right  any faults will be found and and flagged up in a report<br>   
  Then moving on to user testing which is letting people use the website this will give me feedback on what people think about my site and the usability and give me feedback where i could improve if needed
